From the dataset in Table 7.5 (page 154, SIDS data) from Everitt, solve the following exercises:

1. Extract as much as possible information coming out from the data set using graphical tools as described in Chapter 2 of Everitt.

2. Perform a PCA and interpret the results.

3. Find homogeneous clusters amongst the individuals without considering the variable Group (use hierarchical and k-means methods under two distinct choices of distance methods). Compare the results with the existing groups given by variable "group". Then perform LDA and 
classify into these groups the following two new observations: 
Obs1: (110,3320,0.240,39); Obs2: (120,3310,0.298,37).
